        <h1>Italian Penicillin Soup</h1>
        <h2>About the dish</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, the best remedy for a cold—or just a long day—is a steaming bowl of soup. Enter Italian Penicillin Soup, lovingly known as Sick Day Soup or Chicken Pastina Soup. While it might not come with a doctor's seal of approval, this rich, aromatic dish is the ultimate comfort on a chilly day, offering a perfect blend of tradition and ease.</p>
        <p>What sets this apart from standard chicken noodle soup? The simmered vegetables are blended and stirred back into the broth—a “genius” move that adds both body and complexity. Cooking the pastina directly in the broth thickens it just enough, while fresh herbs and a Parmesan rind elevate the flavor to something truly special.</p>                    
        <p>“Honestly, this will be the only way I make chicken noodle soup from now on,” says recipe tester Amanda Holstein. Whether you're under the weather or just craving something cozy, this hearty soup is destined to become your cold-weather favorite.</p>
